\section{Design}

\subsection{Description/About}

Assignment for this project can be divided into these subtasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User input handling
\item Processing of DNS data
\item Exporting to Syslog server
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1cm}
\textbf{User input handling}

This task includes argument parsing, asserting for certain input conditions and general execution configurations.

\vspace{1cm}
\textbf{Processing of DNS data}

While the processing of DNS messages could be considered as the primary task of this project, several prior processing steps are required for an effective DNS analysis.
Before it becomes possible to parse DNS messages on the application layer, application needs to descend layer by layer and test for various conditions.
First, L2 or the link layer protocols are parsed, with support of Ethernet and Linux Cooked Header frames. Second, L3 or network layer protocols are parsed (IPv4 and IPv6).
Then, L4 or transport layer protocols are parsed (TCP and UDP). Finally, L7 or the application layer is unveiled and DNS data can be parsed.

\vspace{0.5cm}

All of the DNS communication is carried in a single format called \textit{a message}.
To properly parse \textit{a message}, it's structure needs to be understood.

\end{figure}

\textbf{DNS Header} has a fixed length, therefore its data structure representation can be easily casted upon the raw data.
Header includes significant meta data about the message, such as the number of questions and answers it carries 
or whether the message is a query or a response or even flags signaling corrupted or invalid messages.
This can be used for more directed parsing and filtering out those messages that this project doesn't care about.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{dns-question}
\centering
\caption{4.1.2. Question section format | RFC 1035}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Question section} of every DNS packet should contain an initial query. 

Queries contain three fields: \textit{QNAME}, \textit{QTYPE} and \textit{QCLASS}.

\caption{4.1.3. Resource record format | RFC 1035}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Answer section} is the most meaningful section of a DNS message, as it contains the valuable response/responses for each query.
Answer sections shares the same format of resource records as the two other sections following it (Authority and Additional), however they are not used in this project.
Answers contain three fields: \textit{NAME}, \textit{TYPE}, \textit{CLASS}, \textit{TTL}, \textit{RDLENGTH} and most importantly, \textit{RDATA}.
